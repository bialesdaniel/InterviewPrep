Problem 1:
I think the worst case time complexity is O(m*n)
I think the worst case space complexity is O(m*n)

Problem 2:
I think the worst case time complexity is O(2 * listLength), though I'm not quite sure of that
I think the worst case space compleity is O(listLength * listLength), though I'm not quite sure of that.
I believe javascript copies the variables so there would be a list for every function call.
